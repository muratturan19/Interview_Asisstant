Limited grammar/vocabulary significantly affects expression. Response is limited in content and development.\n\n1 (Weak): Very little relevant content. Speech is unclear. Severe problems with grammar/vocabulary.\n\n0: No attempt or completely off-topic.\n\nEVALUATION CRITERIA:\n- Delivery (15%): Pace, clarity, pronunciation, intonation\n- Language Use (40%): Grammar accuracy, vocabulary range and precision, sentence complexity\n- Topic Development (45%): Relevance, organization, coherence, supporting details\n\nProvide scores for each question (0-4), calculate total (sum * 1.5 = /30), and CEFR level.",
